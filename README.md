# Click Released Beta#

## A tool for avoiding click bait on social media ##

## Summary ##
  > See an article that looks too good to be true? Did a friend share the latest diet or exercise trend and you want to see whether it really holds up? Click Released Beta frees you from the click-bait by leveraging the power of Watson to verify the science behind the fluff.

## Problem ##
  > Articles gain traction without being verified
  > Facebook filters and sorts your newsfeed without considering underlying validity
  > Ads and sponsored content can appear indistinguishable from legitimate, well-researched content

## Solution ##
  > Click Released Beta offers a simple user interface for you to copy-paste any article or content shared on social media for verification. It keeps track of articles for additional published research to monitor changes over time.

## How to Get Started ##
  > The Beta version of Click Released is a standalone site that can be accessed at http://heroku.com/click-released-beta. Future versions will be integrated into the browser as a plug-in.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I wish I had this before I did that week long juice cleanse Dr. Oz was promoting."
