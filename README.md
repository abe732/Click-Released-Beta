# Click Released Beta#

## A tool for avoiding the filter bubble on social media ##

## Summary ##
  > See an article that looks too good to be true? Not sure what type of bias you're encountering when reading things your friends share on social media? Click Released Beta pops the filter bubble by leveraging the power of Watson to expose bias and show you alternative narratives for the things you read.

## Problem ##
  > Bias is often implied and covert
  > Facebook filters and sorts your newsfeed to reinforce your bias, not challenge it
  > Ads and sponsored content can appear indistinguishable from legitimate, well-researched content

## Solution ##
  > Click Released Beta offers a simple user interface for you to copy-paste an article shared on social media to determine it's bias and present alternatives.

## Customer Quote ##
